       The body of knowledge of physical therapy is large, and therefore physical
       therapists may specialize in a specific clinical area. While there are many
       different types of physical therapy, the American Board of Physical Therapy
       Specialties lists ten current specialist certifications. Most Physical
       Therapists practicing in a specialty will have undergone further training,
       such as an accredited residency program, although individuals are currently
       able to sit for their specialist examination  after 2,000 hours of focused
       practice in their respective specialty population, in addition to
       requirements set by each respective specialty board.
